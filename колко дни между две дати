Days to Apply at Software University
Problem Definition
Currently Software University is accepting applications for the spring semester.
These applications have fast approaching deadline. 
After the deadline a new introductory course Programming Basics is starting to 
ensure the candidates are well prepared for the entry exam on 28th April 2015.
Write a program that reads from the console the name of the user and prints a message,
notifying him how many days he has left for application for the spring semester at Software University. 
The days should be printed in binary representation of the number.
Input
The input will be a single line, holding the name of the user.
Output
The output should consists of a single line, holding the string: 
"{name}, you have only {binaryDays} days to apply for the spring semester at Software University!".
 {name} is the name of the user, read from the console.
 {binaryDays} is the binary representation of the number of days left for application for the spring semester at Software University.
Constraints
 The input will always be a single line;
 Time limit: 0.1 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB.
Example
Note: Below is a sample pair of input and output strings as if today is 1st January 2015. 

Input Ivan 

Output Ivan, you have only 1010010 days to apply for the spring semester at Software University!

				+ "semester at Software University!", name, binaryPeriod);
